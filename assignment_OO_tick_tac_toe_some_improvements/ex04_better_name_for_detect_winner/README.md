# Assignment: OO Tic Tac Toe

## Exercise description
Speaking of better names, let's take a look at our Board#detect_winner method. The method name is ambiguous about what this method does. Just looking at the name, we wouldn't be surprised if it returned a Player object or a symbol. Let's rename it to reflect what it does: winning_marker. This new name reminds us that the method will return the winning marker, or nil in the case of no winning marker. After you change the method definition, don't forget to also update all method invocations.
