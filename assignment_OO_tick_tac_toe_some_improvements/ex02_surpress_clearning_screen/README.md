# Assignment: OO Tic Tac Toe

## Exercise description
The first time we display a board, we want to suppress the clearing of the screen. This is so we can see the welcome message, or the play again message. However, the method invocation, display_board(false) is incredibly vague. Six months from now, no one will remember what that false stands for without looking at the method implementation. Let's change the method so that we can invoke it like this: display_board(clear_screen: false).
