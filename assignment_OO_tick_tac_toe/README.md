# Assignment: OO Tic Tac Toe

## Exercise description
In this assignment, we'll build a Tic Tac Toe game, just like the one we built before. This game is a little bit more complicated than Rock, Paper, Scissors, because there's the notion of a "game state", which should represent the current state of the board (the RPS game didn't have game state, only choices).

### Problem decomposition
