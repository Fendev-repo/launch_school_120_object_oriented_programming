## Exercise description
Computer turn refinements

a) We actually have the offense and defense steps backwards. In other words, if the computer has a chance to win, it should take that move rather than defend. As we have coded it now, it will defend first. Update the code so that it plays the offensive move first.

b) We can make one more improvement: pick square #5 if it's available. The AI for the computer should go like this: first, pick the winning move; then, defend; then pick square #5; then pick a random square.

c) Can you change the game so that the computer moves first? Can you make this a setting at the top (i.e. a constant), so that you could play the game with either player or computer going first? Can you make it so that if the constant is set to "choose", then your game will prompt the user to determine who goes first? Valid options for the constant can be "player", "computer", or "choose".
